# Dotfiles
My linux configuration files for my (now deprecated) Pop Os machine. I've had to update the kernel version so have moved to
using Solus. I'm keeping this repository up as a reference for others. I managed these files with [yadm](https://yadm.io/) and 
am currently trying to find other ways to manage my config.
